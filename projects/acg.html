                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>2019 was the year of massive internal change for Sandi Mitchell’s business management firm, and she wanted her brand to
                    accurately reflect this new stage of her company. She had the name – Apex Catalyst Group. Now she needed a new logo, a
                    cohesive brand style, and a client-facing website.</p>
                    <p>Over 7 months, I worked with Sandi to develop a logo, website, and branding materials that matched her positivity,
                    bright personality, and contagious enthusiasm for growth. Sandi spends her days helping others discover their inner
                    superhero – I wanted to make sure her brand properly showcased her own incredible superpowers.</p>

                    <h5>Understanding Sandi and ACG</h5>
                    <p>At our Design Kick-Off, I asked Sandi what she believed made her company unique.</p>
                    <p>She talked a lot about the countless obstacles and responsibilities that business leaders must address and how
                    overwhelming that can be to navigate. With an experienced guide by their side, a leader can synthesize all of the chaos
                    into clarity.</p>
                    <p>But for Sandi, it’s not just about helping leaders understand what they need to do. It’s about empowering individuals to
                    become the leaders they’ve always wanted to be. She identifies and celebrates each of her client’s superpowers. Her team
                    brings positivity and inspires confidence with every meeting. She offers a powerful, uplifting mix of emotional
                    intelligence and analytical prowess to the businesses she works with. It’s her passion to watch those that she’s helped
                    follow their pathway to success.</p>
                    <p>As Sandi told me all of this, I identified her company’s key values that I wanted to evoke with this rebrand: <strong>Confidence, Positivity, Connection, Individual Achievement, and Accelerated Growth.</strong></p>

                    <h5>Sketching Ideas</h5>
                    <p>Now that I had a stronger feel for Sandi and her company, I started sketching potential ideas for the logo. Logo ideas
                    didn’t come easily to me this time, but where inspiration fails me, iteration and research gets me further down the
                    road. I explored popular logo layouts, researched symbols that represent ACG’s company values, and played with different
                    font and color combinations. I filled several pages with sketches and concepts.</p>
                    <div uk-lightbox>

                    </div>

                    <p>From my hodgepodge of ideas, I selected my best three concepts and refined them into full-color logos, then presented
                    the logo concepts to Sandi to see which elements, if any, resonated with her.</p>
                    <p>The first one resonated the best. We took this version for feedback and into the second round for design improvements.</p>

                    <h5>Finalizing the Logo</h5>
                    <p>Initial feedback on the logo was generally positive. People tended towards a sans-serif version of the logo, and I also
                    got a great recommendation during this time to check how the logo would look in a solid color – the answer was it looked
                    like a chunky blob. To fix this, I separated the leaf blades and really emphasized the silhouettes of each blade. I also
                    created an alternative logo that explored a different floral pattern.</p>

                    represent growth and mastery. I also included a touch of Sandi in the design, since the general form and color scheme
                    was inspired by her favorite flower, the Bird of Paradise.</p>

                    <h5>Wireframing & Content</h5>
                    <p>As I work more in web development, I’ve learned that design and content is a bit of a chicken-or-the-egg situation.
                    Effective design can only occur once the content is finalized, but it’s difficult to create strong content without
                    visualizing what’s possible in the space it’ll occupy (not to mention content creation is one of the hardest and longest
                    parts of making a website).</p>
                    <p>To get the ball rolling, I created the first version of the site map then designed some quick-and-dirty wireframes that
                    used popular dummy elements found in company websites, like featured blog posts and clients. Sandi and her content
                    writers were able to use this as a framework to start the content creation process.</p>

                    <p>Once I had the first draft of content, I was able to flesh out the wireframes. I focused on layout and form, identifying
                    areas where I could include visuals or icons to break up the text and create flow. The content writers and I bounced
                    ideas back and forth to ensure the copy fit in well in a responsive web format. I also began visualizing a consistent
                    design format that each page would follow.</p>
                    <p>Towards the end, I reconsidered how to do the navigation bar. I had learned that it’s generally better to keep the top
                    navigation simple and short, so I had combined ACG’s three main services under a parent link named ‘Services’. However,
                    I saw that some of ACG’s competitors split apart their services to have their own place in the top navigation. I thought
                    this was a clever yet still simple way to immediately advertise the services of ACG to users and adapted the sitemap to
                    follow a similar model.</p>

                    <h5>Mock-up and Style Tile</h5>
                    <p>With the content and layout 90% of the way there, I started on the visual design of the website. I had already
                    completed the logo at this point, so my main colors and fonts were already decided.</p>
                    <p>The plan was to only create a high-fidelity prototype of the homepage, since the remaining pages would follow the same
                    design system. I would also build out a style tile – a mini design system document that illustrated the main colors,
                    typography and components used in the website.</p>
                    <p>As usual for my design process, nothing seemed to work at first. I played with several different elements, like color
                    overlays on pictures, fancy borders, and gradients galore. I ran into lots of contrast issues, and a lot of my ideas
                    just weren’t visually pleasing.</p>

                    <p>I kept poking and prodding though, and eventually I came to a design both Sandi and I really liked. I popped in the
                    company photos, developed the icon style, and made a last-minute change to the color scheme to improve readability. Now
                    we were ready to actually make this vision happen!</p>

                    <h5>Developing the Website in WordPress</h5>
                    <p>My original plan for this project was to build a custom WordPress template from scratch. However, I realized that buying
                    and customizing a pre-built template would make a lot more sense. It was cheaper to do for one, and since ACG’s website
                    didn’t require a lot of custom functionality, it would speed up my development time significantly. It would also be easier for the client to maintain on their end. The <a href="https://avada.theme-fusion.com/">Avada WordPress
                    theme</a> offered significant flexibility and customization that was perfect for the project, so I bought the license and
                    got to work.</p>
                    <p>Most of the development was plopping in content and fine-tuning the CSS to match my design mock-up. There was nothing
                    particularly tricky to develop, but I devoted a lot of time making small improvements here and there, like adding subtle
                    animations, optimizing images, or ensuring it still looked great at all screen sizes. I’m quite happy with the final
                    result.</p>

                <div class="text-block">
                    <p>This project was my first venture into work outside of college. When I started, I wanted to start a freelancing company
                    for design work, and this was a great project to start building my portfolio and network. Sandi really is a superhero,
                    and I was excited for the opportunity to help expand her company that she built from scratch.</p>
                    <p><strong>Designing the logo was an exciting prospect for me, since my work would be the face of the company.</strong> Visual design
                    doesn’t come easily to me, so I was a bit apprehensive as well, especially since I was constantly hitting roadblocks for
                    the first few weeks. I am extremely pleased with my final result, however, which came about from weeks of iteration,
                    brainstorming, and feedback.</p>
                    <p><strong>I was much more comfortable with the website, since frontend design/development is my specialty.</strong> It was an
                    interesting opportunity to refine a process and tech stack that optimized development time, flexibility, and
                    maintenance expectations. I learned a lot about working with clients, like managing expectations, simplifying mock-ups
                    to focus on what’s important, and inevitably pivoting when a new requirement popped up.</p>
                    <p><strong>The branding media package was also a fun exercise in visual design.</strong> It was less pressure to work on this since I had
                    already done the hard work of defining the brand style with the logo and website. I hadn’t worked much with print
                    design before, so it was informative to learn about using the right paper sizes and color profiles.</p>
                    <p><strong>I eventually decided that freelancing wasn’t for me at this point in my life</strong> – not because of anything wrong with this
                    project, but because I realized that I was much happier and more productive with a structured job. I also realized that
                    while I had a business mind, I didn’t have a business heart. I had a tendency to do free work out of a desire to help,
                    and I’ve never been one to easily promote myself and my work.</p>
                    <p>All in all, I’m glad for the opportunity to flex my design and business skills, and I’m excited that I got to create all
                    of this for someone who is very important to me and who I admire a great deal.</p>
